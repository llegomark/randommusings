As sure as the sun ascends over the peaks of the Sierra Madre, glimmering radiantly off the azure splash of Hinulugang Taktak Falls, I find myself, once more, engulfed in the throbbing heart of contemplation, nestled within the serene embrace of Antipolo City.

There is a weighty silence that precedes the dawn here, an echoing abyss that murmurs of cosmic solitude and my own insignificance in its vastness. In those ['dim hours'](https://llego.dev/posts/nocturnal-code-whimsy-everyday-magic-software-engineers-life/), I wrestle vehemently with the gnawing conundrums of existence— the contradictions of being and nothingness that have cracked the minds of contemplatives before me.

Every man treads two universes - the outer, of concrete and color, of boisterous jeepneys racing past, the fragrance of simmering adobo wafting from corner karinderyas; the inner, of thoughts and emotions, filled with desperate questions and unresolved paradoxes. Is consciousness a mere by-product of complex physical processes, or could it truly be an entity separate from the tangible world? How could we reconcile our vivid subjectivity with the objective reality we participate in?

As I sit on a wooden pew within the hushed sanctum of the Antipolo Cathedral, surrounded by echoes of fervent prayers and hope-filled dreams, I am plagued by an existential ache that knots my stomach. I am a man caught between worlds, succumbing to neither faith's comforting embrace nor the cold aloofness of skepticism.

From the materialistic precipice, I peer into the void. If consciousness is rooted entirely in the mud of physicality, what becomes of human dignity, purpose, and meaning? Where do we pin that spark of creativity, of love, of transcendent hope, within the grey choreography of firing neurons?

Yet, to leap off the precipice, I'd have to immerse myself in the theological waters; accept, on faith, the existence of a celestial watchmaker who, for reasons unfathomable, set this cosmic performance into motion. In this abyss of faith and doubt, I tread water, perpetually caught in a maelstrom of thought.

Wherever I lay my gaze – be it upon the rhythmic rustle of fallen mango leaves or the vibrant strokes of colors in Pinto Art Museum – I am grappled by the paradoxical wonder of it all. Our narrative as a species, as conscious beings born of this Earth, is ironically both banal and miraculous, bearing the watermark of the absurdity that French existentialist Albert Camus mused upon.

Are we not all sentenced to life, expected to carve meaning from the chaotic stone of existence, while shrouded in the uncertain silence of the cosmos, awaiting our inevitable eviction from consciousness?

My introspective journey, much like my aimless evening walks through the winding streets of Barangay Mayamot, has been laced with longing, despair, and isolation. Yet, the struggle has proved itself a unique crucible for resilience, compassion, and enlightenment.

In my fervent dance with philosophy, I have stumbled, but also spun elegiac solos of insight. I recognize the human condition's inherent dissonance—the eerie silence of the cosmos taunting our inner chaos— and in it, I find strength. It is the acceptance of absurdity that enables the leap of faith we call life.

Antipolo, my quiet sanctuary, with its verdant hills whispering stories of yesteryears, becomes a poignant landscape mirroring my existential plight—a man aflame with questions, grappling with the might of life's enigmas in this vast celestial theater. Yet, I am but a solitary voice among billions.

And thus, dear reader, invite you to echo your own dissonance, your hopes, fears, joy, and despair, in the vast theatre of existence. For it is in our shared symphony of absurdity, that we find our ['solitary tunes'](https://llego.dev/posts/echoes-solitude-journey-self-discovery/) forming a poignant melody called "Humanity". Perhaps it is not in finding answers, but in the quest itself, that this delicate melody rings true.
