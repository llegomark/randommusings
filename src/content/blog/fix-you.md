Dear Mark,

I know that there are days when life feels like it might be too much. Days when you've tried your hardest, but it seems like nothing is working out. When you get everything you've wanted, but somehow it's not what you need â€“ it feels like you've been stuck in reverse, moving further away from where you want to head. I want you to know during those times, I see your struggle, ['I feel your pain'](https://llego.dev/posts/kidrock-only-god-knows-why/), and I'm here with you.

I see the fatigue etched in your face when you're restless and tired, yet sleep eludes you. And I'm here, witnessing the silent tears that stream down your face in the quiet solitude of the night. Sometimes you lose things you can't replace, or perhaps love you've offered has seemed wasted, but dear Mark, could this be worse?

No, it does not define the essence of your worth. You are not the lost battles or the misplaced affections. You are so much more than the disappointments - your courage amid adversity, your strength in vulnerability, and your unwavering capacity to love.

I want you to remember, as the haunting lyric goes, "lights will guide you home." Even in your darkest hours, there are lights flickering in the distance, waiting to escort you safely home. Let them rekindle the flame in you, ignite your bones, breathe new life into your weary spirit.

There's an extraordinary courage that comes from admitting when we need help. Mark, in those moments, I want to be there for you. I want to try to "fix" you, not because you're broken, but because you're deserving of love and healing.

But remember, too, how important it is to also let go. It could be high up above or deep down below, you might find yourself clinging tightly to the things and people you love. Sometimes, it's hard to loosen that grip. But, as Coldplay sings, "if you never try, you'll never know, just what you're worth." Letting go isn't about losing, it's about discovering your inherent value, independent of anything else.

Tears may stream down your face, but know that each tear is a reminder not of defeat, but of your human capacity to feel, to love, and to grow. I promise you, I, too, will learn from my mistakes. I will strive to offer you a better version of myself each time.

We will tread this journey together, Mark. Let the lights guide us home. Let the experiences - good and bad - set our souls on fire, carve out a more profound, more empathetic version of who we could be. I will be there for you, through the ups and the downs, through the joy and the tears.

You are not alone. Remember, love and hope are always within our reach, and they are potent enough to heal and brave enough to comfort.

With love,

Mark
