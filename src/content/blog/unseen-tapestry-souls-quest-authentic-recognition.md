With every beat of my heart, there is a story. Days are woven into weeks, months into years, threading the tapestry of my life with intricate patterns that never seem to fully emerge in conversations or fleeting glances between strangers. Today, I won't blame the world for not trying to understand. After all, behind the everyday facade, there lies a narrative, a personal narrative that language often fails to capture.

Sometimes, I hear echoes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdYWuo9OFAw" target="_blank">'Iris.'</a> The haunting melody of the Goo Goo Dolls sinks under my skin, unraveling threads of emotions buried deep within. Lyrics weave through my veins, touching places inside me that I never knew existed, giving voice to my longing—a longing that fills my soul to the brink, yearning for the comfort of a gaze that truly perceives.

The chorus reaches its crescendo—"I just want you to know who I am."

The song isn't merely about ['exposing vulnerabilities'](https://llego.dev/posts/kidrock-only-god-knows-why/); it’s about the craving to share them, to have them held reverently in another's hands, inspected and understood in all their depth and complexity. I long for that kind of connection—a soul resonance, to be deeply seen. Not just for the laughter and the courage I wear on my sleeve, but for the fears that hide in the corners of my smile, for the innocence that flees from the sharp corners of the world, for the hopes that painfully linger despite life's relentless disappointments.

Why do I want this? It's more than validation. It’s a yearning for acknowledgment that ['these textures of my soul are real'](https://llego.dev/posts/echoes-evolution-dance-inner-demons/), they exist, and aren't just solipsistic impressions living in the silence of my heart.

I am more than my surface persona—more than the ordinary 32-year-old you see, always neatly dressed, the one who silently observes life with careful eyes, the one who casually shrugs off heavy questions about love and life, labeling them as too philosophical or deep.

Piercing through the canopy of normalcy, there are stories that seldom find voice: stories of the lullabies that comforted me to sleep, the delightful thrill of the first summer rain, the quiet tragedies that sculpted me through the years. There is a fierce sense of tenacity concealed behind a steady gaze, dreams incubating inside hollow nights nurtured by a passion that refuses to bow before harsh realities.

Meeting me is like reading a book whose words are masks. Behind each carefully chosen expression, there are underlying chapters. Sometimes, I wish someone would commit to reading it, fondly yet resolutely turn the pages, making sense of the ['abstract metaphors'](https://llego.dev/posts/navigating-landslide-journey-time-love-self-discovery/), decoding the cryptic allusions, encountering the world that I am inside.

Every locked gaze feels like a chance for discovery, a possibility. I search for that mirrored recognition, an echo of my own soul's language in someone else's eyes. It’s not merely about being seen; I want someone to look at me and say, "I see you, and I see myself. We're the same."

But until I find that recognition, until the words, ‘I see you’ are etched in someone's gaze, I will continue painting my emotions on the ['canvas of solitude'](https://llego.dev/posts/echoes-solitude-journey-self-discovery/), carving my dreams on the stones of silence, longing for the day when someone shatters through the soundless echo of my solitary heart – wishing to truly understand, wishing to meet my eyes and see who I am, unmasked and unrestrained.

As 'Iris' echoes in the stillness, I'm left to hope that there's a melody strong enough, a sight clear enough, a love brave enough, to discern the ['true narrative of my life'](https://llego.dev/posts/silent-symphony-alienation-tale-self-acceptance/).
