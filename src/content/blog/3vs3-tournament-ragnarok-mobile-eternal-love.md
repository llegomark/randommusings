![Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love](https://llego.dev/assets/Screenshot_2023.09.14_22.30.19.953.png)

Hey there! I've recently been working on some code for our upcoming Internal 3vs3 PVP in our striking Hellion Guild. I wanted to showcase my Python skills by creating a fun and interactive tournament simulation for Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love.

My code aims to simulate an exciting round-robin style tournament between teams of 3 players each. I added random buffs and debuffs based on the player's job rankings and skill levels to make things interesting. This introduces a level of unpredictability and strategy to the matches. Remember that this simulation does not consider the players' equipment, stats, skills, or other attributes. It is purely a simulation and does not reflect the actual gameplay mechanics of Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love.

I created the `Player,` `Team,` and `SkillInteractions` classes in the code to represent individual players, teams, and skill interactions between players. Each player is assigned a name, job, skill, and equipment level. The team's total strength is calculated based on the combined strength of its members.

I used various calculations and data structures to determine the tournament's winner and performance metrics. The most valuable player (MVP) is calculated based on the average strength of each player throughout the matches.

In the modified version of the code, I added several new features. Firstly, I implemented a class called `SkillInteractions` to handle skill interactions between players. This class defines dictionaries for synergy, counter, status effects, combo breakers, buffs, and debuffs. This class's `apply_skill_interactions` method uses skill interactions to modify the players' strengths.

I also added a `Plotter` class to handle plotting functionalities for the tournament results. This class includes methods for plotting the progression of the winning team's score, the top 3 players based on total strength, the performance of jobs in the tournament, the distribution of player strengths, and the individual strength progression of each player.

Furthermore, I modified the `Player` class to include new attributes and methods. Each player now has an `average_strength` attribute to store their average strength throughout the matches and a `num_wins` attribute to keep track of the number of wins during the tournament. The `strength` method in the `Player` class now considers the skill interactions between players to calculate the modified strength of the player.

The `calculate_mvp` function was modified to accept the new player performance dictionary and calculate the MVP based on the average strength of each player.

Lastly, the `apply_buffs_debuffs` function was added to apply random buffs and debuffs to players' skill levels and job rankings based on their jobs.

This modified code should provide an enhanced and more comprehensive simulation of the 3vs3 PVP tournament in Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love. I'm excited about our upcoming PVP, and I hope this code contributes to the fun and competitive spirit of the event. Let's enjoy the tournament, and may the best team emerge victorious in Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. See you on the battleground!

## Example Code Outputs

The Most Valuable Player is: Suzy

The winning team is: Team 11
