In the summer of my years, I found an invigorating kinsmanship with solitude. It was an occasion to familiarize myself with the voice within, a whisper often drowned in the cacophony of everyday life. In my solitude, I became both the ['solitary traveler'](https://llego.dev/posts/dawn-antipolo-existential-journey-life-consciousness/) and the entire journey.

The quiet, at first, seemed oppressive, a sensory deprivation that loomed large and unfeeling. But, within this silence, I discovered sound— the faint echo of my thoughts reverberating in every corner of my being. The walls of my self-made sanctuary became a mirror reflecting my innermost thoughts, dreams, and fears, each more vivid and commanding than the last.

There was liberation in this solitude; the conventional bounds of societal expectations could no longer chain me. In these hallowed aisles of introspection, I was the sole architect of my reality. I found joy in my own company, learned to savor the unique flavor of my laughter, and gradually embraced the healing touch of my comforting silence.

Yet, there were moments when solitude felt like a cage, its iron bars crafted from my insecurities. There were days when the echo of my voice was deafening when the familiarity of my thoughts morphed into a chorus of excruciating redundancy. In these instances, I questioned the worthiness of my journey, yearning for the touch of another's presence and longing for an affirmation of existence outside of my echo chamber.

But even in these darker shades, I realized, one garners indelible lessons. In the oppressive quiet, I learned to listen. In those daunting moments of self-questioning, I discovered my resilience. Solitude, thus, was not just an absence of external engagement; it was a canvas painted with stark contrast, with strokes of light and shadows equally crucial in creating the complete picture.

My journey of solitude has led to the emergence of intricate philosophies and evolving ideologies. I no longer shun my shadows, nor do I solely glorify the light. I appreciate the necessity of both, for the absence of one renders the existence of the other impossible. There's a newfound respect for balance, for the undulating rhythm inherent to the human experience.

This solitary expedition has crafted an introspective alignment between my interactions with the external world and my self-perception. I'm not apart from the world but an integral part of it— a single note in the grand orchestration of existence. The wisdom etched in the silken webs of my solitude now guides my traverse in bustling society, the echo of my whispered self-discoveries offering a compass in interactions with others.

['As a man of 31'](https://llego.dev/posts/nocturnal-code-whimsy-everyday-magic-software-engineers-life/), every meeting with solitude is a note in the song of my life. My solitude is not flawless, often marred with minor scratches of reality and unforgiving whispers of uncertainty. But, oh, the honesty of those knots! They, too, are part of the experience, the authenticity that carves depth into my journey.
