My Dearest Yhabz, Arlene,

As I sit here tonight, overlooking the peaceful city lights, I am moved to pen down the profound love and gratitude I feel for you. Our journey together has been nothing short of an epic love story, with 'Chasing Cars' by Snow Patrol as our soundtrack, weaving memories into a narrative that moves us. One such memory is etched in my heart forever – the time when you turned our tiny, rented apartment into a loving sanctuary for our blossoming family.

This tranquil place, which we made home years ago, is where we've lived our shared dreams, raising Desmond and Argi Denise amidst laughter, tears, love, and triumphs. Here we learnt to chase life's fleeting moments with the same fervor as 'chasing cars,' fully aware of their ephemeral yet precious nature.

Our daily routines have bloomed into a comforting rhythm. The way the morning sunlight filters through the curtains, casting a warm glow over our shared bed, the melodious laughter of our children, echoing through our home, our intimate conversations over strong, aromatic coffee, and the shared glances amidst changing diapers or doing the dishes – these ordinary moments now signify extraordinary significance.

Our love, Yhabz, has evolved, just like us. From being two independent souls seeking dreams to a united couple that can 'do it all, everything on our own.' Not needing embellishments to color our canvas, we have discovered joy in our shared independence, and an intimacy that has become our haven.

The evolution of our shared dreams became evident when we started supporting each other's individual dreams. Your unwavering faith in my aspirations and your resilience when things go awry, especially remind me of the line from 'Chasing Cars' - 'I need your grace to remind me to find my own.'

At times, words fall short to express the depth of my love for you, because 'those three words are said too much and they're not enough.' But understand this, my adoration for you transcends language limitations, and measures deeper than the Mariana Trench, higher than Mount Everest.

Each passing day feels like watching a vibrant garden in full bloom—evolving and filled to the brim with life. Our journey towards our shared future, let's say our never-ending adventures—raising our kids to be compassionate human beings, exploring new cities, and diving deeper into understanding each other, grows in beauty and eloquence, casting a living testament to our love.

In your perfect eyes, 'all that I am, all that I ever was,' finds a profound reflection. The way you see me, with unconditional love and acceptance, even as our lives transition, our love remains constant—a beacon in life's whirlwind. Our shared sentiments remain unfluctuating, casting a warm glow over our past, present and everything yet to bloom.

So, my love, "if I just lay here, would you lie with me and just forget the world?" I remember our impromptu picnic in the park, where we lay side by side, watching the clouds morph, and I yearn to replicate such moments with you, to behold the beauty and simplicity of life.

In commemorating the six-years of our incredible journey together, I want to honor and cherish the path we've traveled side by side. Each step, each day, each year has added a layer of invaluable richness to our shared journey. So, "Happy sixth anniversary," though doesn't capture the depth of my happiness, let it echo the resonance of our indissoluble bond.

Let's continue 'chasing cars,' wasting time in the best way possible, savoring our love amidst the twinkling city lights, and relishing the bliss of our close-knit family. Your existence, Arlene, is both my solace and my guiding light in our sometimes chaotic, yet beautiful world, and my heart is a vessel filled with nothing but love for you.

These words etched here are a tribute to our love, an emblem of the myriad moments we've shared and the life that we've built, brick by brick, together. Here's to us, to our beautiful journey, and to a future filled with countless more years of love and fleeting moments.

With all the love in my heart,

Mark
