Hello! Welcome to my world. I'm Mark Anthony Llego, a seasoned ['software engineer'](https://github.com/llegomark) at the crossroads of coding and living. I've channeled my long-standing fascination with artificial intelligence, specifically in natural language processing and large language models, into a career dedicated to creating intelligent solutions poised to reshape our daily experiences.

Skilled in Python and JavaScript, I develop innovative applications powered by the might of machine learning and neural networks. Utilizing modern web development frameworks and implementing SEO best practices, I stride confidently at the forefront of the software universe, pushing its boundaries.

Syncing my strides with the dynamic evolution of technology, I immerse myself in the latest breakthroughs in AI-related fields. My broad experience with natural language processing, image and speech recognition, and various AI-driven applications underline my commitment and curiosity in this expansive domain.

But there's more to me than code and algorithms. My blog reveals a vivid kaleidoscope of my thoughts, insights, and adventures. It's a platform where I paint a vibrant joie de vivre, sprinkled with wit and humor. Fasten your seatbelts, as we embark on an unpredictable journey across the whimsical and intriguing landscape of my mind!

Beyond the digital realm, I unplug to delve into the virtual world of Ragnarok M: Eternal Love, a different kind of passion tracing back to my high school days. An ardent supporter of former Vice President Maria Leonor "Leni" Gerona Robredo, I stand by her forward-looking vision for our nation.

Above all, my most cherished roles are those of a father to my wonderful children, Desmond Grey and Argi Denise, and supportive husband to my wife, Arlene. Balancing the wonders of tech, the ['allure of gaming'](https://llego.dev/posts/kidrock-only-god-knows-why/), personal advocacy, and the warmth of family, my story is about bridging different worlds.

So, welcome to my shared universe of technology, personal musings, and a heartwarming familial journey. A space where technical expertise, whimsical thoughts, and a fulfilling personal journey converge to create a truly unique experience.

I believe in being judicious when sharing aspects of my personal life online, limiting it to only provide a modest glimpse. My portfolio, carefully crafted to best demonstrate my skills, abilities, and experiences, is shared exclusively with companies and employers to whom I personally apply.

Rest assured, I am more than willing to provide you with these requested materials should the right opportunity of collaboration arise.

Thank you once again for expressing interest in my work. If you find my approach aligns with yours, I am only one conversation away from revealing my professional persona in more detail.
