## Hello! Welcome

You've landed in my world, and I am Mark Anthony Llego, standing at the exciting crossroads of coding and life. I am a freelance software engineer, blending my passion for artificial intelligence, specifically natural language processing, and large language models into a career aimed at transforming everyday experiences.

## On Professional Front

- Skilled in an array of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML5, I've honed the skills to develop smart, data-intensive applications.
- Utilizing libraries and frameworks like React.js, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, ExpressJS, Django, and Flask, I have the versatility to craft varied web applications, each tailored to its unique requirements.
- My experience with database management ranges from SQL-based systems, such as SQLite and MySQL, to NoSQL solutions like MongoDB and Firebase, enabling the handling of diverse data structures.
- I work comfortably with machine learning libraries such as PyTorch and Scikit-Learn, bringing innovative solutions in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing to life.
- Adept at deploying CSS preprocessors like SASS, and utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, I shape aesthetic and responsive web designs.
- Applying SEO best practices and speed enhancement techniques, my proficiency with WordPress and hosting services like Google Cloud ensure optimized visibility and user experience.
- Experienced with Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, I create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations and narrative text - essential for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulations, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
- Familiar with Git for version control, I streamline processes and collaborations, maintaining high efficiency in my workflow.
- Proficient in developing and maintaining APIs, paving the way for seamless integration and communication between different software components.
- Acquainted with cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, I manage large datasets, efficiently deploying models in alignment with the rapidly evolving tech sphere.
- Securing and optimizing performance of websites using Cloudflare, my sites consistently secure high-ranking search results.

## A Window To My Mind

But hey, I'm more than just code and algorithms! My blog is a canvas where I share my thoughts, adventures, sprinkled with wit and humour.

## Beyond Coding

Stepping beyound the realm of bits and bytes, I am drawn to the virtual world of Ragnarok M: Eternal Love. Further, my heart beats for the forward-looking vision of former Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Gerona Robredo.

## My Pride and Joy

Amidst all the techno frenzy, I take immense pride in being a father to my wonderful children, Desmond Grey and Argi Denise, and a supportive husband to my wife, Arlene.

## Welcome Aboard

So here's to a joint voyage that weaves together technology, whimsical thoughts, and heartwarming family tales, stages where technical expertise, fanciful notions, and a fulfilling personal life intersect.
